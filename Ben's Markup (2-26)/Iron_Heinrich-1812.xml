    <title>The Frog King or Iron Heinrich</title>
    <author>Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm</author>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a princess who went out into a forest and <action agency="passive"
            gender="female" willingness="neutral">sat</action> next to a cool well.</p>
    <p>She took great pleasure in <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager"
            >throwing a golden ball</action> into the air and <action agency="active"
            gender="female" willingness="eager">catching</action> it, but once it went too high. She
            <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">held out her</action> hand
        with her fingers curved to catch it, but it fell to the ground and rolled and rolled right
        into the water.</p>
    <p><descriptor type="negative" gender="female">Horrified</descriptor>, the princess <action
            agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral">followed it with her
            eyes</action>, but the well was so deep that she could not see its bottom.</p>
    <p>Then she began to <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral">cry</action>
        <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">bitterly</descriptor>, I'd give anything, if
        only I could get my ball back: my clothes, my precious stones, my pearls, anything in the
        world.</p>
    <p>At this a frog <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="neutral">stuck his
            head</action> out of the water and said, "Princess, why are you <action agency="passive"
            gender="female" willingness="neutral">crying</action> so <descriptor type="negative"
            gender="female">bitterly</descriptor>?"</p>
    <p>"Oh," she said, "you <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">ugly</descriptor> frog, how
        can you help me? My golden ball has fallen into the well."</p>
    <p>The frog said, "I do not want your pearls, your precious stones, and your clothes, but if
        you'll accept me as a companion and let me sit next to you and eat from your plate and sleep
        in your bed, and if you'll love and cherish me, then I'll <action agency="active"
            gender="male" willingness="hesitant">bring your ball</action> back to you."</p>
    <p>The princess thought, "What is this <descriptor type="negative" gender="male"
            >stupid</descriptor> frog trying to say? After all, he does have to stay here in the
        water. But still, maybe he can get my ball. I'll go ahead and say yes," and she <action
            agency="active" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">said aloud</action>, "Yes, for
        all I care. Just bring me back my golden ball, and I'll promise everything."</p>
    <p>The frog <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">stuck his head under the
            water</action> and <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager"
            >dove</action> to the bottom.</p>
    <p>He returned a short time later with the golden ball in his mouth and <action agency="active"
            gender="male" willingness="eager">threw it onto the land</action>.</p>
    <p>When the princess saw her ball once again, she <action agency="active" gender="female"
            willingness="eager">rushed toward it</action>, <action agency="active" gender="female"
            willingness="eager">picked it up</action>, and was so <descriptor type="positive"
            gender="female">happy</descriptor> to have it in her hand again, that she could think of
        nothing else than to <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">run
            home</action> with it.</p>
    <p>The frog <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">called after her</action>,
        "Wait, princess, take me with you like you promised," but she paid no attention to him.</p>
    <p>The next day the princess was <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral"
            >sitting at her table</action> when she heard something coming up the marble steps:
        plip, plop. Then there came a <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager"
            >knock</action> at the door, and a voice called out, "Princess, <descriptor
            type="positive" gender="female">youngest</descriptor>, open the door for me!"</p>
    <p>She <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">ran</action> and <action
            agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">opened the door</action>. It was the
        frog, whom she had put completely out of her mind. <descriptor type="negative"
            gender="female">Frightened</descriptor>, she <action agency="active" gender="female"
            willingness="eager">slammed</action> the door shut and <action agency="passive"
            gender="female" willingness="eager">returned</action> to the table. The king saw that
        her heart was pounding and asked, "Why are you afraid?"</p>
    <p>"There is a <descriptor type="negative" gender="positive">disgusting</descriptor> frog out
        there," she said, "who got my golden ball out of the water. I <action agency="passive"
            gender="female" willingness="hesitant">promised</action> him that he could be my
        companion, but I didn't think that he could leave his water, but now he is just outside the
        door and wants to come in."</p>
    <p>Just then there came a second <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager"
            >knock</action> at the door, and a voice <action agency="active" gender="male"
            willingness="eager">called</action> out: <lg>
            <l><descriptor type="positive" gender="female">Youngest</descriptor> daughter of the
                king,</l>
            <l>Open up the door for me,</l>
            <l>Don't you know what yesterday,</l>
            <l>You said to me down by the well?</l>
            <l><descriptor type="positive" gender="female">Youngest</descriptor> daughter of the
                king,</l>
            <l>Open up the door for me.</l>
        </lg>
    </p>
    <p>The king said, "What you have promised, you must keep. Go and let the frog in."</p>
    <p>She went and <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="hesistant">opened</action>
        the door, and the frog hopped in, then <action agency="active" gender="male"
            willingness="neutral">followed</action> her up to her chair. After she had <action
            agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral">sat down again</action>, he
            <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">called out</action>, "Lift me
        up next to you."</p>
    <p>The princess did not want to, but the king <action agency="active" gender="male"
            willingness="neutral">commanded</action> her to do it. When the frog was seated next to
        her he said, "Now <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant"
            >push</action> your golden plate closer. I want to eat from it."</p>
    <p>She had to do this as well. When he had <action agency="passive" gender="male"
            willingness="eager">eaten</action> all he wanted, he said, "Now I am tired and want to
        sleep. Take me to your room, make your bed, so that we can lie in it together."</p>
    <p>The princess was <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">horrified</descriptor> when she
        heard that. She was <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">afraid</descriptor> of the
        cold frog and did not dare to even touch him, and yet he was supposed to lie next to her in
        her bed; she began to <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral"
            >cry</action> and didn't want to at all.</p>
    <p>The king <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="neutral">became angry</action>
        and <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="neutral">commanded her</action> to do
        what she had promised.</p>
    <p>There was no helping it; she had to do what her father wanted, but in her heart she was
            <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">bitterly angry</descriptor>. She <action
            agency="active" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">picked up the frog</action> with
        two fingers, <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">carried
            him</action> to her room, and <action agency="active" gender="female"
            willingness="hesitant">climbed into bed</action>, but instead of laying him next to
        herself, she <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">threw him</action>
        bang! against the wall. "Now you will leave me in peace, you <descriptor type="negative"
            gender="male">disgusting</descriptor> frog!"</p>
    <p>But when the frog came down onto the bed, he was a <descriptor type="positive" gender="male"
            >handsome</descriptor>
        <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">young</descriptor> prince, and he was her
            <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">dear</descriptor> companion, and she held him
        in <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">esteem</descriptor> as she had promised, and
        they fell asleep together with pleasure.</p>
    <p>The next morning the prince's <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">faithful</descriptor>
        Heinrich arrived in a splendid carriage drawn by eight horses, decorated with feathers and
        glistening with gold. He had been so <descriptor type="negative" gender="male"
            >saddened</descriptor> by the prince's transformation that he had had to place three
        iron bands around his heart to keep it from bursting in sorrow. The prince <action agency="active" gender="male"
            willingness="neutral">climbed</action> into the
        carriage with the princess. His faithful servant <action agency="passive" gender="male"
            willingness="eager">stood</action> at the rear to drive them to his
        kingdom. After they had gone a short distance, the prince heard a crack from behind, as
        though something had broken.</p>
    <p>He turned around and said, "Heinrich, the carriage is breaking apart."</p>
    <lg>
        <l>No, my lord, the carriage it's not,</l>
        <l>But one of the bands surrounding my heart,</l>
        <l>That suffered such great pain,</l>
        <l>When you were sitting in the well,</l>
        <l>When you were a frog.</l>
    </lg>
    <p>Once again, and then once again the prince heard a cracking sound and thought that the
        carriage was breaking apart, but it was the bands springing from <descriptor type="positive"
            gender="male">faithful</descriptor> Heinrich's heart because his master was now redeemed
        and happy.</p>
