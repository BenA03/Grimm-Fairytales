            <h2>Our Corpus</h2>
            <p>Since there are many translations and editions of the Grimm's Fairytales, we have
                decided to use one source for our research. The collection, included below, was
                compiled by D. L. Ashliman, who was a professor at The University of Pittsburgh. His
                site allows us to view English translations of many of the works, in addition to
                offering a comparison between the 1812 and 1857 editions. <a

            <h2>Our Stories</h2>
            <p>Considering the scope and timeline of this project, we have decided to limit our
                research to a subset of the stories. Included are the stories we are
                investigating:</p>

            <p>Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, popularly known as the Brothers Grimm, were academics and
                librarians. These two brothers compiled different fairytales into what we now know
                as the Grimm's Fairytales. However, the first collection of 53 stories wasn't
                published during their lifetime. It wouldn't be until 1812, when a different
                collections of stories was published by the brothers. Different versions of Kinder-
                und Hausmärchen, whcih translates to Children's and Household Tales, would be
                translated all the way up to 1857. The 1857, or 7th edition, is the final version
                and is what serves as the basis for many of the versions translated and published
                aftet the brothers' death.</p>

            <h2>Markup Methodology</h2>
            <p>For our project, we’re interested in seeing how the relationship between gender and
                action is portrayed in Grimm’s fairytales and if this changes over time. To do this
                we looked at both well-known and lesser known tales with two versions of each tale
                from different years. The stories we chose were: Little Red Riding Hood,
                Rumplestiltskin, The Robber Bridegroom, Frau Holle, Rapunzel, Hansel and Grettle,
                Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, The Singing Bone, Girl Without Hands, Hans-my-hedgehog,
                and Frog King. We used a collection compiled by a previous Pitt professor, D. L.
                Ashliman. This collection contains translations from the original German to English
                with versions from different parts of the 1800s.</p>
            <p>Each tale’s version was marked up according to our schema. This schema consisted of
                three elements: descriptor, action, and empty. Descriptor was further broken down
                into the attributes of type and gender. Type had the values of positive, neutral,
                and negative. We used type and its values as a way to see how genders were portrayed
                not only by their actions but by their description. This was done so that we could
                compare the language used to describe female characters versus male characters to
                see what this told us about how the Grimm’s fairytales portrayed gender.</p>
                <p>Additionally, we looked at the actions of these characters, ascribing the
                attributes: agency, gender, and willingness. Agency had a value of either active or
                passive and willingness had values eager, neutral, and hesitant. These action
                attributes and their values are the meat of our argument. They allow us to see how
                gender in the tales were actually allowed to act. Our empty element was for a happy
                ending, which all of our stories had. We chose to include the happy ending element
                because we thought that it would be interesting to show whether a story had a happy
                ending and women were portrayed in a more positive light or if the story did not
                have a happy ending and the women were portrayed in a more negative light, and vice
                versa with men.</p>
