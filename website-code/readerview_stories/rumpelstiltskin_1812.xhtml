   <h2>Rumpelstiltskin (1812)</h2>
   
   <p>Once upon a time there was a <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">miller</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span>
      who was <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">poor</span><span class="hover">negative, male</span>, but who had a
      <span class="hoverable female_descriptor">beautiful</span><span class="hover">positive, female</span> daughter. Now it
      happened that he <span class="hoverable male_action">got into a
         conversation with the king and said to him: "I have a daughter who knows the art of
         turning straw into gold."</span><span class="hover">passive, male, eager</span></p>
   
   
   <p>So the king <span class="hoverable male_action">immediately sent
         for the miller's daughter and ordered her to turn a whole room full of straw into
         gold in one night</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>. And if she could not do it, she would have to die. She
      <span class="hoverable female_action">was locked in the
         room, and she sat there and cried, because for her life she did not know how the
         straw would turn into gold</span><span class="hover">passive, female, hesitant</span>.</p>
   
   
   <p>Then suddenly a <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">little</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span> man <span class="hoverable male_action">appeared before her, and said:
         "What will you give me, if I turn this all into gold?"</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span> She <span class="hoverable female_action">took off her necklace and
         gave it to the <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">little</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span>
         man</span><span class="hover">active, female, hesitant</span>, and he <span class="hoverable male_action">did
         what he had promised</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>.</p>
   
   
   <p>The next morning the king <span class="hoverable male_action">found the room filled with gold, and his heart became even more <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">greedy</span><span class="hover">negative, male</span></span><span class="hover">passive, male, eager</span>. He put the miller's
      daughter into an even larger room filled with straw, and told her to <span class="hoverable female_action">turn it into gold</span><span class="hover">passive, female, hesitant</span>.
      The <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">little</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span> man <span class="hoverable male_action">came again</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>. She <span class="hoverable female_action">gave him a ring from her
         hand</span><span class="hover">active, female, eager</span>, and he <span class="hoverable male_action">turned it all into gold</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>.</p>
   
   
   <p>The third night the king <span class="hoverable female_action">had her locked in a third room, which was larger than the first two, and entirely
         filled with straw</span><span class="hover">passive, female, hesitant</span>. "If you succeed this time, <span class="hoverable male_action">I'll <span class="hoverable female_action">make you my wife</span><span class="hover">passive, female, neutral</span></span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>," he said.</p>
   
   
   <p>Then the <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">little</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span> man came and said,
      "<span class="hoverable male_action">I'll do it
         again</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>, but you <span class="hoverable female_action">must promise me the first child that you have with the king</span><span class="hover">passive, female, hesitant</span>."</p>
   
   
   <p>In her distress she <span class="hoverable female_action">made
         the promise</span><span class="hover">active, female, hesitant</span>, and when the king <span class="hoverable male_action">saw that this straw too had been turned into gold, he took the
         miller's daughter as his wife</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>.</p>
   
   
   <p>Soon thereafter the queen <span class="hoverable female_action">delivered a child</span><span class="hover">active, female, neutral</span>. Then the <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">little</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span> man <span class="hoverable male_action">appeared before her and demanded the child that had been promised him</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>. The
      queen <span class="hoverable female_action">begged him to let
         her keep the child, offering him great riches in its place</span><span class="hover">passive, female, hesitant</span>.</p>
   
   
   <p>Finally he said, "I'll <span class="hoverable male_action">be back
         to get the child in three days</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>. But <span class="hoverable female_action">if by then you know my name, you can keep the
         child</span><span class="hover">passive, female, neutral</span>.!"</p>
   
   
   <p>For two days the queen <span class="hoverable female_action">pondered what the <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">little</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span>
         man's name might be, but she could not think of anything, and became very
         sad</span><span class="hover">passive, female, hesitant</span>. On the third day the king <span class="hoverable male_action">came home from a hunt and told her how, two days earlier, while
         hunting deep in a dark forest, he had come upon a little house</span><span class="hover">passive, male, eager</span>. A
      <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">comical</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span>
      <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">little</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span> man <span class="hoverable male_action">was there, jumping about as if on one leg, and
         crying out</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>:</p>
   
   <span class="lg">
      <span class="l"><span class="hoverable male_action">Today I'll bake; tomorrow
            I'll brew</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>.</span>
      <span class="l"><span class="hoverable male_action">Then I'll fetch the queen's
            new child</span><span class="hover">active, male, eager</span>.</span>
      <span class="l">It is good that no one knows</span>
      <span class="l">Rumpelstiltskin is my name.</span>
      </span>
   
   
   <p>The queen <span class="hoverable female_action">was overjoyed to
         hear this</span><span class="hover">passive, female, eager</span>.</p>
   
   
   <p>Then the <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">dangerous</span><span class="hover">negative, male</span>
      <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">little</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span> man arrived and asked:
      "Your majesty, what is my name?"</p>
   
   
   <p>"Is your name Conrad?"</p>
   
   
   <p>"No."</p>
   
   
   <p>"Is your name Heinrich?"</p>
   
   
   <p>"No."</p>
   
   
   <p>"Then could your name be Rumpelstiltskin?"</p>
   
   
   <p>"The devil <span class="hoverable female_action">told you
         that</span><span class="hover">passive, female, eager</span>!" shouted the <span class="hoverable male_descriptor">little</span><span class="hover">neutral, male</span> man. He <span class="hoverable male_action">ran away angrily, and never came back</span><span class="hover">active, male, hesitant</span>.</p>
