                    <p>Thank you for visiting our site! This is research project associated with the
                        Computational Methods for the Humanities course at the University of
                        Pittsburgh. This site intends to document our research as our team explores
                        gender portrayal across multiple editions of the classic Grimm's Fairytales.
                        As our project develops, we anticipate the creation of new or more specific
                        reseach questions. These are the questions that are currently facilitating
                        our research:</p>
                    <h2>Our research questions</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are the descriptors for women generally more positive or negative
                            compared to men? Are women or men given a more active role?</li>
                        <li>How does the association between the fairy tales and marketing towards
                            children lead to a shift in content within the stories, especially in
                            regards to gender portrayal?</li>
                    </ul>

            <p><strong>Samantha Allen</strong> is a junior majoring in Linguistics with a focus in
                East Asian Studies. She took this course as a requirement for the major and to learn

            <p><strong>Emily Drzymalski</strong> is a senior double majoring in English
                writing and history with a minor in film analysis. She took this course as her final
                general education requirement because she wanted more experience with programming
                and liked the humanities angle of this course.</p>
            <p>A special thanks to our project mentor Mason Gobat and our professor David Birnbaum
