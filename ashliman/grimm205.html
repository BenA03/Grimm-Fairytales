Once there were two sisters; the one had no children and was rich; the 
other had five children, was a widow, and was so poor that she no longer 
had enough bread to feed herself and her children.  <p> 
In distress she went to her sister and said, "My children and I are 
starving.  You are rich; give me a bite of bread."  <p> 
The rich but hard-hearted woman said, "I don't have anything in my house 
either," and with angry words she sent the poor woman away.  <p> 
Some time later the rich sister's husband came home and wanted to cut 
himself a piece of bread, but when he cut into the loaf, red blood gushed 
from it. When his wife saw this, she became horrified and told him what 
had happened.  He hurried away and wanted to help.  When he entered the 
poor widow's room, he found her there praying.  She was holding the two 
youngest children in her arms; the three oldest ones were lying there 
dead.  <p> 
He offered her food, but she answered, "We no longer need earthly food; 
God has filled three already, and will hear our prayers as well."  <p> 
She had hardly uttered these words when the two small ones stopped 
breathing, whereupon her heart broke too, and she sank down dead.
