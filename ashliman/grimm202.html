<h3>Children's Legends, No. 2</h3>
<h1>The Twelve Apostles </h1>
<h2>Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm</h2>
</center>
It was three hundred years before the birth of Christ the Lord, and there 
lived a mother who had twelve sons, but she was so poor and needy that she 
did not know how she would be able to keep them alive. She prayed daily to 
God that he might allow her sons to be together on earth with the promised 
savior. When her need became even greater she sent them, one after the 
other, out into the world to seek something to eat. <p> 
The oldest one was named Peter. He went forth, and had already walked far, 
an entire day's journey, when he found himself in a great forest. He 
looked for a way out, but could not find one, going instead deeper and 
deeper into the woods. His hunger was so great that he could barely stand 
upright. He finally became so weak that he had to lie down, and he 
believed that he was near death. <p> 
Suddenly there stood before him a small boy. He glistened, and was as 
beautiful and as friendly as an angel. The child clapped his hands 
together, causing Peter to look up at him. Then he said, "Why are you 
sitting there so sadly?" <p>
"Oh," answered Peter, "I am walking about in the world seeking something 
to eat, so that I might be able to see the promised savior, for that is my 
greatest wish." <p> 
The child said, "Come with me. Your wish shall be fulfilled." <p>
He took poor Peter by the hand and led him between the cliffs to a large 
cave. They went inside, and everything glistened with gold, silver, and 
crystal. In the middle there stood twelve cradles next to each other. <p>
Then the little angel said, "Lie down in the first one, and sleep a 
little. I will rock you." <p>
Peter did this, and the little angel sang to him and rocked him until he 
fell asleep. <p>
While he slept the second brother came to him. He too had been brought 
there by his guardian angel, and he too was rocked to sleep. In a like 
manner the others came as well, each in turn, until all twelve were lying 
there asleep in the golden cradles. There they slept for three hundred 
years until the night when the savior of the world was born. Then they 
awoke and were with him on earth, and they were called the twelve 
apostles. <p>
