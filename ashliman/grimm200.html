<P>Once in the wintertime when the snow was very deep, a poor boy had to
go out and fetch wood on a sled.  After he had gathered it together and
loaded it, he did not want to go straight home, because he was so frozen,
but instead to make a fire and warm himself a little first.  So he scraped
the snow away, and while he was thus clearing the ground he found a small
golden key.  Now he believed that where there was a key, there must also
be a lock, so he dug in the ground and found a little iron chest.  "If
only the key fits!" he thought.  "Certainly there are valuable things in
the chest."  He looked, but there was no keyhole.  Finally he found one,
but so small that it could scarcely be seen.  He tried the key, and
fortunately it fitted.  Then he turned it once, and now we must wait until
he has finished unlocking it and has opened the lid.  Then we shall find
out what kind of wonderful things there were in the little chest.</P>

<li>This story was added to the Grimms' collection as no. 161 (the final
tale) of their second edition (1819). Their immediate source was a Hessian
story told to them by family friend Marie Hassenpflug. From the second
edition onward this story has occupied the last position in the collection
(excluding the appendix of ten <i>Children's Legends</i>). By closing
their collection with this enigmatic tale without an end, the Grimms seem
to be saying that folktales, too, are endless.  There is no final word.<p>
