<P>Once there was a poor woman who had two children. The youngest one had
to go into the forest every day to fetch wood. Once when he had gone a
very long way to find wood, a child who was very little but very strong
came to him and helped him gather the wood and carried it up to his house,
but then in the wink of an eye he disappeared. The child told his mother
about this, but she did not believe him. Finally the child brought a rose
and said that the beautiful child had given it to him and that when the
rose was in full blossom he would come again. The mother placed the rose
into water. One morning the child did not get up; the mother went to his
bed and found him lying there dead. On that same morning the rose came
into full blossom.</P>

<li>The Grimms received this legend from the Westphalian family von
Haxthausen. <p>

the Grimms' <i>Children's and Household Tales</i> with the second edition
(1819). In succeeding editions, until and including the final edition of
1857, "The Rose" underwent only superficial stylistic changes.
