    <body>
        <p>Next to a great forest there lived a <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">poor
                woodcutter</descriptor> with his wife and his two children. The boy's name was
            Hansel and the girl's name was Gretel. He had but little to eat, and once, when a great
            famine came to the land, <action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">he
                could no longer provide even their daily bread.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">One evening as he was lying in
                bed worrying about his problems,</action> he sighed and said to his wife, "What is
            to become of us? How can we feed our children when we have nothing for ourselves?"</p>
        <p>"Man, do you know what?" answered the woman."Early tomorrow morning we will take the two
            children out into the thickest part of the woods, make a fire for them, and give each of
            them a little piece of bread, then leave them by themselves and go off to our work. They
            will not find their way back home, and we will be rid of them."</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">"No, woman," said the man. "I
                will not do that. How could I bring myself to abandon my own children alone in the
                woods? Wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces."</action></p>
        <p>"Oh, <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">you fool,"</descriptor> she said, "then
            all four of us will starve. All you can do is to plane the boards for our coffins."
                <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">And she gave him no
                peace until he agreed.</action></p>
        <p>"But I do feel sorry for the poor children," said the man.</p>
        <p>The two children had not been able to fall asleep because of their hunger, and they
                <action agency="passive" gender="mixed" willingness="neutral">heard what the
                stepmother had said to the father.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral">Gretel cried bitter
                tears</action> and said to Hansel, "It is over with us!"</p>
        <p>"Be quiet, Gretel," said Hansel, "and don't worry. I know what to do."</p>
        <p>And as soon as the adults had fallen asleep, <action agency="active" gender="male"
                willingness="eager">he got up, pulled on his jacket, opened the lower door, and
                crept outside.</action> The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles in
            front of the house were glistening like silver coins. Hansel bent over and filled his
            jacket pockets with them, as many as would fit.</p>
        <p>Then he went back into the house and said, "Don't worry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will not
            forsake us." Then he went back to bed.</p>
        <p>At daybreak, even before sunrise, the woman came and woke the two children. <descriptor
                type="negative" gender="mixed">Get up, you lazybones.</descriptor> We are going into
            the woods to fetch wood." <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager"
                >Then she gave each one a little piece of bread, saying, "Here is something for
                midday. Don't eat it any sooner, for you'll not get any more."</action></p>
        <p>Gretel put the bread under her apron, because Hansel's pockets were full of stones. Then
            all together they set forth into the woods. After they had walked a little way, Hansel
                <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">began stopping again and
                again and looking back toward the house.</action></p>
        <p>The father said, "Hansel, why are you stopping and looking back? Pay attention now, and
            don't forget your legs."</p>
        <p>"Oh, father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my white cat that is sitting on the roof and
            wants to say good-bye to me."</p>
        <p>The woman said, <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">You fool,</descriptor> that
            isn't your cat. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."</p>
        <p>However, <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager"> Hansel had not been
                looking at his cat but instead had been dropping the shiny pebbles from his pocket
                onto the path.</action></p>
        <p>When they arrived in the middle of the woods, the father said, "You children gather some
            wood, and I will make a fire so you won't freeze."</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">Hansel and Gretel gathered
                together some twigs,</action> a pile as high as a small mountain</p>
        <p>The twigs were set afire, and when the flames were burning well, the woman said, "Lie
            down by the fire and rest. We will go into the woods to cut wood. When we are finished,
            we will come back and get you."</p>
        <p>Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire. When midday came each one ate his little piece of
            bread. Because they could hear the blows of an ax, they thought that the father was
            nearby. However, it was not an ax. It was a branch that he had tied to a dead tree and
            that the wind was beating back and forth. After they had sat there a long time, their
            eyes grew weary and closed, and they fell sound sleep.</p>
        <p>When they finally awoke, it was dark at night. Gretel began to cry and said, "How will we
            get out of woods?"</p>
        <p>Hansel comforted her, "Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we'll find the
            way."</p>
        <p>After the full moon had come up, <action agency="active" gender="male"
                willingness="eager">Hansel took his little sister by the hand.</action> They <action
                gender="mixed" agency="active" willingness="eager">followed the pebbles that
                glistened there like newly minted coins, showing them the way. They walked
                throughout the entire night, and as morning was breaking, they arrived at the
                father's house.</action></p>
        <p>They knocked on the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and
            Gretel, she said, You <descriptor type="negative" gender="mixed">wicked</descriptor>
            children, why did you sleep so long in the woods? We thought that you did not want to
            come back."</p>
        <p>But the father was <descriptor type="positive" gender="male"> overjoyed</descriptor> when
            he saw his children once more, for <action agency="passive" gender="male"
                willingness="eager">he had not wanted to leave them alone.</action></p>
        <p>Not long afterward there was once again great need everywhere, and one evening the
            children heard the mother say to the father, "We have again eaten up everything. We have
            only a half loaf of bread, and then the song will be over. <action agency="active"
                gender="female" willingness="eager">We must get rid of the children. We will take
                them deeper into the woods, so they will not find their way out. Otherwise there
                will be no help for us."</action></p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="hesitant">The man was very
                disheartened, and he thought, "It would be better to share the last bit with the
                children."</action></p>
        <p>But the woman would not listen to him, scolded him, and criticized him. He who says A
            must also say B, and because he had given in the first time, he had to do so the second
            time as well.</p>
        <p>The children were still awake and had overheard the conversation. When the adults were
            asleep, <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Hansel got up again
                and wanted to gather pebbles as he had done before,</action> but the <action
                agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">woman had locked the
                door,</action> and <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Hansel
                could not get out. But he comforted his little sister and said, "Don't cry, Gretel.
                Sleep well. God will help us."</action></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">Early the next morning the
                woman came and got the children from their beds. They received their little pieces
                of bread, even less than the last time.</action> On the way to the woods, Hansel
            crumbled his piece in his pocket, then often stood still, and threw crumbs onto the
            ground.</p>
        <p>"Hansel, why are you always stopping and looking around?" said his father. "Keep walking
            straight ahead."</p>
        <p>"I can see my pigeon sitting on the roof. It wants to say good-bye to me."</p>
        <p><descriptor type="negative" gender="male">"Fool,"</descriptor> said the woman, "that
            isn't your pigeon. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."</p>
        <p>But little by little <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Hansel
                dropped all the crumbs onto the path.</action>
            <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">The woman took them deeper
                into the woods than they had ever been in their whole lifetime.</action></p>
        <p>Once again a large fire was made, and the mother said, "Sit here, children. If you get
            tired you can sleep a little. We are going into the woods to cut wood. We will come and
            get you in the evening when we are finished."</p>
        <p>When it was midday <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">Gretel
                shared her bread with Hansel, who had scattered his piece along the path.</action>
            <action agency="passive" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">Then they fell asleep, and
                evening passed, but no one came to get the poor children.</action></p>
        <p>It was dark at night when they awoke, and <action agency="active" gender="male"
                willingness="eager">Hansel comforted Gretel and said, "Wait, when the moon comes up
                I will be able to see the crumbs of bread that I scattered, and they will show us
                the way back home."</action></p>
        <p>When the moon appeared <action agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">they
                got up, but they could not find any crumbs,</action> for the many thousands of birds
            that fly about in the woods and in the fields had pecked them up.</p>
        <p>Hansel said to Gretel, "We will find our way," but they did not find it.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">They walked through the entire
                night and the next day from morning until evening, but they did not find their way
                out of the woods.</action> They were terribly hungry, for they had eaten only a few
            small berries that were growing on the ground. And because they were so tired that their
            legs would no longer carry them, <action agency="passive" gender="mixed"
                willingness="eager">they lay down under a tree and fell asleep.</action> It was
            already the third morning since they had left the father's house. <action
                agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">They started walking again, but
                managed only to go deeper and deeper into the woods.</action> If help did not come
            soon, they would perish. At midday they saw a little snow-white bird sitting on a
            branch. It sang so beautifully that they stopped to listen. When it was finished it
            stretched its wings and flew in front of them. They followed it until they came to a
            little house. The bird sat on the roof, and when they came closer, they saw that the
            little house was built entirely from bread with a roof made of cake, and the windows
            were made of clear sugar.</p>
        <p>"Let's help ourselves to a good meal," said Hansel. "I'll eat a piece of the roof, and
            Gretel, you eat from the window. That will be sweet."</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Hansel reached up and broke off
                a little of the roof to see how it tasted,</action> while Gretel stood next to the
            windowpanes and was nibbling at them. Then a gentle voice called out from inside:</p>
        <lg>
            <l>Nibble, nibble, little mouse,</l>
            <l>Who is nibbling at my house?</l>
            <l>The children answered:</l>
            <l>The wind, the wind,</l>
            <l>The heavenly child.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>They continued to eat, without being distracted. Hansel, who very much like the taste of
            the roof, <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">tore down another
                large piece,</action> and <action agency="active" gender="female"
                willingness="eager">Gretel poked out an entire round windowpane.</action> Suddenly
            the door opened, and <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">a woman, as old as the
                hills and leaning on a crutch,</descriptor> came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel
            were so frightened that they dropped what they were holding in their hands.</p>
        <p>But the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female">old</descriptor> woman shook her head
            and said, "Oh, you dear children, who brought you here? Just come in and stay with me.
            No harm will come to you."</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">She took them by the hand and
                led them into her house. Then she served them a good meal:</action> milk and
            pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterward <action agency="active" gender="female"
                willingness="eager">she made two nice beds for them,</action> decked in white.
                <action agency="passive" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">Hansel and Gretel went
                to bed, thinking they were in heaven.</action> But the <descriptor type="neutral"
                gender="female">old</descriptor> woman had only pretended to be friendly. She was a
                <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">wicked witch</descriptor>
            <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">who was lying in wait there
                for children. She had built her house of bread only in order to lure them to her,
                and if she captured one, she would kill him, cook him, and eat him; and for her that
                was a day to celebrate.</action></p>
        <p><descriptor type="negative" gender="female">Witches have red eyes and cannot see very
                far, but they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are
                approaching.</descriptor></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">When Hansel and Gretel came
                near to her, she laughed <descriptor type="negative" gender="female"
                    >wickedly</descriptor> and spoke <descriptor type="negative" gender="female"
                    >scornfully</descriptor>, "Now I have them. They will not get away from me
                again."</action></p>
        <p>Early the next morning, before they awoke, she got up, went to their beds, and looked at
            the <descriptor type="positive" gender="mixed"> two of them lying there so peacefully,
                with their full red cheeks.</descriptor> "They will be a good mouthful," she mumbled
            to herself. <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">Then she grabbed
                Hansel with her withered hand and carried him to a little stall, where she locked
                him behind a cage door.</action> Cry as he might, there was no help for him.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">Then she shook Gretel and
                cried,</action> "Get up, <descriptor type="negative" gender="female"
                >lazybones!</descriptor> Fetch water and cook something good for your brother. He is
            locked outside in the stall and is to be fattened up. When he is fat I am going to eat
            him."</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">Gretel began to cry, but
                it was all for nothing. She had to do what the witch demanded.</action> Now Hansel
            was given the best things to eat every day, but Gretel received nothing but crayfish
            shells.</p>
        <p>Every morning the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female">old</descriptor> woman crept
            out to the stall and shouted, "Hansel, stick out your finger, so I can feel if you are
            fat yet."</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">But Hansel stuck out a little
                bone,</action> and the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female">old</descriptor>
            woman, who had bad eyes and could not see the bone, thought it was Hansel's finger, and
            she wondered why he didn't get fat.</p>
        <p>When four weeks had passed and Hansel was still thin, impatience overcame her, and
                <action gender="female" agency="active" willingness="eager">she would wait no
                longer.</action> "Hey, Gretel!" she shouted to the girl, "Hurry up and fetch some
            water. Whether Hansel is fat or thin, <action agency="active" gender="female"
                willingness="eager">tomorrow I am going to slaughter him and boil him."</action></p>
        <p>Oh, how <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">the poor little
                sister sobbed as she was forced to carry the water, and how the tears streamed down
                her cheeks!</action> "Dear God, please help us," she cried. "If only the wild
            animals had devoured us in the woods, then we would have died together."</p>
        <p>"Save your slobbering," said the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female"
                >old</descriptor> woman. "It doesn't help you at all."</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">The next morning Gretel
                had to get up early, hang up the kettle with water, and make a fire.</action></p>
        <p>"First we are going to bake," said the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female"
                >old</descriptor> woman. "I have already made a fire in the oven and kneaded the
            dough."</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">She pushed poor Gretel
                outside to the oven,</action> from which fiery flames were leaping. "Climb in," said
            the witch, "and see if it is hot enough to put the bread in yet." And when Gretel was
            inside, she intended to close the oven, and bake her, and eat her as well.</p>
        <p>But Gretel saw what she had in mind, so she said, "I don't know how to do that. How can I
            get inside?"</p>
        <p>"<descriptor type="negative" gender="female">Stupid goose,"</descriptor> said the
                <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female">old</descriptor> woman. The opening is
            big enough. See, I myself could get in." And she crawled up stuck her head into the
            oven.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">Then Gretel gave her a shove,
                causing her to fall in. Then she closed the iron door and secured it with a
                bar.</action> The <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female">old</descriptor> woman
            began to howl frightfully. <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager"
                >But Gretel ran away, and the <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">godless
                    witch</descriptor> burned up miserably. Gretel ran straight to Hansel, unlocked
                his stall, and cried, "Hansel, we are saved. The <descriptor type="negative"
                    gender="female">old witch</descriptor> is dead."</action></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Then Hansel jumped out, like a
                bird from its cage when someone opens its door.</action> How happy they were! They
            threw their arms around each other's necks, jumped with joy, and kissed one another.
            Because they now had nothing to fear, they went into the witch's house. In every corner
            were chests of pearls and precious stones.</p>
        <p>"These are better than pebbles," said Hansel, filling his pockets.</p>
        <p>Gretel said, <action gender="female" agency="active" willingness="eager">"I will take
                some home with me as well," and she filled her apron full.</action></p>
        <p>"But now we must leave," said Hansel, "and get out of these witch-woods."</p>
        <p>After walking a few hours they arrived at a large body of water. "We cannot get across,"
            said Hansel. "I cannot see a walkway or a bridge."</p>
        <p>"There are no boats here," answered Gretel, "but there is a white duck swimming. If I ask
            it, it will help us across."</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">Then she called
            out:</action></p>
        <lg>
            <l>Duckling, duckling,</l>
            <l>Here stand Gretel and Hansel.</l>
            <l>Neither a walkway nor a bridge,</l>
            <l>Take us onto your white back.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The duckling came up to them, and Hansel climbed onto it, then asked his <descriptor
                type="neutral" gender="female">little sister</descriptor> to sit down next to
            him.</p>
        <p>"No," answered Gretel. "That would be too heavy for the duckling. It should take us
            across one at a time."</p>
        <p>That is what the good animal did, and when they were safely on the other side, and had
            walked on a little while, the woods grew more and more familiar to them, and finally
            they saw the father's house in the distance. <action agency="active" gender="mixed"
                willingness="eager">They began to run, rushed inside, and threw their arms around
                the father's neck.</action></p>
        <p>The <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">man had not had even one happy hour since
                he had left the children in the woods.</descriptor> However, the woman had died.
            Gretel shook out her apron, scattering pearls and precious stones around the room, and
            Hansel added to them by throwing one handful after the other from his pockets.</p>
        <p> Now all their cares were at an end, and they lived happily together.</p>
