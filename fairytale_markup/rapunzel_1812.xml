        <p>Once upon a time there was a man and a woman who had long wished for a child but had
            never received one.</p>
        <p>Finally, however, <action agency="passive" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">the woman
                came to be with child.</action></p>
        <p>Through the small rear window of these people's house they could see into a <descriptor
                type="positive" gender="female">fairy's</descriptor> garden that was filled with
            flowers and herbs of all kinds.</p>
        <p>No one dared enter this garden.</p>
        <p>One day the woman was standing at this window, and she saw the most beautiful rapunzel in a bed.</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">She longed for some, but
                not knowing how to get any, she became miserably ill.</action></p>
        <p>Her husband was <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">frightened</descriptor>, and
            asked her why she was doing so poorly.</p>
        <p>"Oh, if I do not get some rapunzel from the garden behind our house, I shall surely die,"
            she said.</p>
        <p>The man, who loved her dearly, <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager"
                >decided to get her some, whatever the cost.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">One evening he climbed over the
                high wall, hastily dug up a handful of rapunzel, and took it to his
            wife.</action></p>
        <p>She immediately made a salad from it, which she devoured <descriptor gender="female"
                type="negative">greedily.</descriptor></p>
        <p>It tasted so very good to her that by the next day her desire for more had grown
            threefold.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">The man saw that there would be
                no peace, so once again he climbed into the garden.</action></p>
        <p>To his horror, the <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">fairy</descriptor> was
            standing there.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">She scolded him
                fiercely</action> for daring to enter and steal from her garden.</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">He excused himself as best he
                could with his wife's pregnancy, and how it would be dangerous to deny her
                anything.</action></p>
        <p>Finally the <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">fairy</descriptor> spoke, "I will
            accept your excuse and even allow you to take as much rapunzel as you want, if you will
                <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">give me the child that your wife is now
                carrying."</descriptor></p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="neutral">In his fear the man agreed
                to everything.</action></p>
        <p>When the woman gave birth, the <descriptor type="positive" gender="female"
                >fairy</descriptor> appeared, named the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female"
                >little</descriptor> girl Rapunzel, and <action agency="active" gender="female"
                willingness="eager">took her away.</action></p>
        <p>This Rapunzel became the most <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">beautiful
                child</descriptor> under the sun, but when she was twelve years old, the <descriptor
                type="positive" gender="female">fairy</descriptor>
            <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">locked her in a high tower
                that had neither a door nor a stairway, but only a tiny little window at the very
                top.</action></p>
        <p>When the <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">fairy</descriptor> wanted to enter,
                <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">she stood below and
                called out:</action></p>
        <lg>
            <l>Rapunzel, Rapunzel!</l>
            <l>Let down your hair to me.</l>
        </lg>
        <p><descriptor type="positive" gender="female">Rapunzel had splendid hair, as fine as spun
                gold.</descriptor></p>
        <p>When the <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">fairy</descriptor> called out,
                <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral">she untied it, wound
                it around a window hook, let it fall twenty yards to the ground,</action> and the
                <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">fairy</descriptor>
            <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">climbed up it.</action></p>
        <p>One day a <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">young</descriptor> prince <action
                gender="male" agency="active" willingness="eager">came through the forest where the
                tower stood.</action></p>
        <p>He saw the <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">beautiful</descriptor> Rapunzel
            standing at her window, heard her sing with her <descriptor type="positive"
                gender="female">sweet voice,</descriptor> and <action agency="passive" gender="male"
                willingness="eager">fell in love with her.</action></p>
        <p>Because there was no door in the tower and no ladder was tall enough to reach her,
                <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">He came to the forest
                every day,</action> until once he saw the <descriptor type="positive"
                gender="female">fairy,</descriptor> who said:</p>
        <lg>
            <l>Rapunzel, Rapunzel!</l>
            <l>Let down your hair.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Then he knew which ladder would get him into the tower.</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">He remembered the words that
                he would have to speak, and the next day, as soon as it was dark, he went to the
                tower and called upward:</action></p>
        <lg>
            <l>Rapunzel, Rapunzel!</l>
            <l>Let down your hair!</l>
        </lg>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">She let her hair
                fall.</action>
            <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">He tied himself to it and was
                pulled up.</action></p>
        <p>At first Rapunzel was <descriptor gender="female" type="negative"
                >frightened,</descriptor> but soon she came to like the young king so well that
                <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">she arranged for him to
                come every day and be pulled up.</action> Thus they lived in joy and pleasure for a
            long time.</p>
        <p>The <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">fairy</descriptor> did not discover what
            was happening until one day Rapunzel said to her, "Frau Gothel, tell me why it is that
            my clothes are all too tight. They no longer fit me."</p>
        <p><descriptor type="negative" gender="female">"You godless child,"</descriptor> said the
                <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">fairy.</descriptor> "What am I hearing
            from you?" She immediately saw how she had been deceived and was <descriptor
                type="negative" gender="female">terribly angry.</descriptor></p>
        <p>She took Rapunzel's <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">beautiful</descriptor>
            hair, <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">wrapped it a few times
                around her left hand, grasped a pair of scissors with her right hand, and snip snip,
                cut it off.</action></p>
        <p>Then <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">she sent Rapunzel into a
                wilderness</action> where <action agency="passive" gender="female"
                willingness="neutral">she suffered greatly and where, after a time, she gave birth
                to twins, a boy and a girl.</action></p>
        <p>On the evening of the same day that she sent Rapunzel away, the <descriptor
                type="positive" gender="female">fairy</descriptor>
            <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">tied the cut-off hair to the
                hook at the top of the tower,</action> and when the prince called out:</p>
        <lg>
            <l>Rapunzel, Rapunzel!</l>
            <l>Let down your hair!</l>
            <l>she let down the hair.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The prince was startled to find the <descriptor type="positive" gender="female"
                >fairy</descriptor> instead of his <descriptor type="positive" gender="female"
                >beloved</descriptor> Rapunzel.</p>
        <p>"Do you know what, <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">evil</descriptor> one?"
            cried the <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">angry fairy</descriptor>. "You
            have lost Rapunzel forever."</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">The prince, in his despair,
                threw himself from the tower.</action></p>
        <p>He escaped with his life, but he lost his eyesight in the fall.</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="neutral">Sorrowfully he wandered
                about in the forest weeping and, eating nothing but grass and roots.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="neutral">Some years later he happened
                into the wilderness where Rapunzel lived miserably with her children.</action></p>
        <p>He thought that her voice was familiar.</p>
        <p>She recognized him instantly as well and <action agency="active" gender="female"
                willingness="eager">threw her arms around his neck.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">Two of her tears fell into
                his eyes, and they became clear once again, and he could see as well as
                before.</action></p>
