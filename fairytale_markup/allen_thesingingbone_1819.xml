    <title>The Singing Bone</title>

    <author>Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm</author>

    <p>Once upon a time in a certain country there was great concern about a wild boar that was
        destroying the peasants' fields, killing the cattle, and ripping people apart with its
        tusks. The king <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager"> promised a large
            reward to anyone who could free the land from this plague</action>, but the beast was so
        large and strong that no one dared to go near the woods where it lived. Finally the king
            <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">proclaimed that whoever could
            capture or kill the wild boar should have his only daughter in marriage</action>.</p>

    <p>Now in this country there lived two brothers, <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">sons
            of a poor man</descriptor>. They <action agency="active" gender="male"
            willingness="eager">declared that they dared to attempt the task</action>. The
            <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">older</descriptor> one, who was <descriptor
            type="negative" gender="male">crafty</descriptor> and <descriptor type="negative"
            gender="male">shrewd</descriptor>, did so out of pride. The <descriptor type="neutral"
            gender="male">younger</descriptor> one, who was <descriptor type="positive"
            gender="male">innocent</descriptor> and <descriptor type="positive" gender="male"
            >simple</descriptor>, did so because of his <descriptor type="positive" gender="male"
            >kind heart</descriptor>.</p>

    <p>The king said, "In order to be more sure of finding the beast, you should enter the woods
        from opposite sides."</p>

    <p>Thus the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">older one</descriptor>
        <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="neutral">entered the woods from the
            west</action>, and the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">younger one</descriptor>
        from the east.</p>

    <p>After the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">younger one</descriptor> had walked a
        little while, a <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">little dwarf</descriptor>
        <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="neutral">stepped up to him</action>. He
        held a black spear in his hand and said, "<action agency="active" gender="male"
            willingness="eager">I am giving you this spear because your heart is <descriptor
                type="positive" gender="male">innocent</descriptor> and <descriptor type="positive"
                gender="male">good</descriptor>.</action> With it you can confidently attack the
        wild boar. It will do you no harm."</p>

    <p>He <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">thanked the dwarf, put the spear
            on his shoulder, and walked on <descriptor type="positive" gender="male"
                >fearlessly</descriptor>.</action></p>

    <p>Before long he saw the beast. It attacked him, but <action agency="passive" gender="male"
            willingness="neutral">he held the spear toward it, and in its blind fury it ran into the
            spear with such force that its heart was slashed in two</action>.</p>

    <p>Then <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">he put the monster on his back
            and turned towards home, intending to take it to the king</action>.</p>

    <p>Emerging from the other side of the woods, he <action type="active" gender="male"
            willingness="neutral">came to a house where people were making merry drinking wine and
            dancing</action>. His <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">older</descriptor>
        brother was there too. Thinking that the boar would not run away from him any time soon, he
            <action type="passive" gender="male" willingness="neutral">had decided to drink himself
            some real courage</action>. When he saw his younger brother coming out of the woods with
        his booty, his <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">envious</descriptor> and
            <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">evil</descriptor> heart gave him no peace.</p>

    <p>He <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">called out to him</action>,
        "Come in, <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">dear brother</descriptor>. Rest and
        refresh yourself with a beaker of wine."</p>

    <p>The <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">younger</descriptor> brother, suspecting no
        evil, <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">went in and told him about
            the <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">good</descriptor> dwarf who had given him
            the spear with which he had killed the boar</action>.</p>

    <p>The <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">older</descriptor> brother <action
            agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">kept him there until evening</action>,
        and then <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="neutral">they set forth
            together</action>. After dark they came to a bridge over a brook, and the <descriptor
            type="neutral" gender="male">older</descriptor> brother <action agency="passive"
            gender="male" willingness="eager">=let the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male"
                >younger one</descriptor> go first</action>. When the <descriptor type="neutral"
            gender="male">younger</descriptor> brother reached the middle above the water, the
            <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">older</descriptor> one <action agency="active"
            gender="male" willingness="eager">gave him such a blow from behind that <action
                agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="neutral">he fell down
            dead</action></action>.</p>

    <p>He <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">buried him beneath the bridge,
            took the boar, and delivered it to the king, pretending that he had killed it</action>.
        With this he <action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">received the king's
            daughter in marriage</action>.</p>

    <p>When his <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">younger</descriptor> brother did not return
        he said, "The boar must have ripped him apart," and every one believed it.</p>

    <p>But as nothing remains hidden from God, this black deed was also to come to light.</p>

    <p>After many long years a <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">shepherd</descriptor>
        <action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="neutral"> was driving his herd across
            the bridge and saw a little snow-white bone lying in the sand below</action>. Thinking
        that it would make a good mouthpiece, he <action agency="active" gender="male"
            willingness="eager">climbed down, picked it up, and then carved out of it a mouthpiece
            for his horn</action>. When he blew into it for the first time, to his great
        astonishment the bone began to sing by itself:</p>

    <lg>
        <l>Oh, my <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">dear shepherd</descriptor>,</l>
        <l>You are blowing on my little bone.</l>
        <l>My brother <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">killed
            me</action>,</l>
        <l>And <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">buried me beneath the
                bridge</action>,</l>
        <l>To get the wild boor</l>
        <l>For the daughter of the king.</l>
    </lg>

    <p>"What a wonderful horn," said the shepherd. "It sings by itself. I must take it to the
        king."</p>

    <p>When he brought it before the king, the horn again began to sing its little song. The king
        understood it well, and <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">had the
            earth beneath the bridge dug up</action>. Then the whole skeleton of the murdered man
        came to light.</p>

    <p>The <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">wicked</descriptor> brother could not deny the
        deed. He <action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="hesitent">was sewn into a sack
            and drowned alive</action>. The <action agency="passive" gender="male"
            willingness="neutral">murdered</action> man's bones <action agency="passive"
            gender="male" willingness="neutral">were laid to rest in a beautiful grave in the
            churchyard</action>.</p>
