    <p>Once upon a time there was a <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">miller</descriptor> who
        was <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">poor</descriptor>, but who had a <descriptor
            type="positive" gender="female">beautiful</descriptor> daughter. Now it happened that he
            <action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">got into a conversation with
            the king and said to him: "I have a daughter who knows the art of turning straw into
            gold."</action></p>

    <p>So the king <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">immediately sent for
            the miller's daughter and ordered her to turn a whole room full of straw into gold in
            one night</action>. And if she could not do it, she would have to die. She <action
            agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">was locked in the room, and she
            sat there and cried, because for her life she did not know how the straw would turn into
            gold</action>.</p>

    <p>Then suddenly a <descriptor type="neutral">little</descriptor> man <action agency="active"
            gender="male" willingness="eager">appeared before her, and said: "What will you give me,
            if I turn this all into gold?"</action> She <action agency="active" gender="female"
            willingness="hesitant">took off her necklace and gave it to the <descriptor
                type="neutral" gender="male">little</descriptor> man</action>, and he <action
            agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">did what he had promised</action>.</p>

    <p>The next morning the king <action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">found
            the room filled with gold, and his heart became even more <descriptor type="negative"
                gender="male">greedy</descriptor></action>. He put the miller's daughter into an
        even larger room filled with straw, and told her to <action agency="passive" gender="female"
            willingness="hesitant">turn it into gold</action>. The <descriptor type="neutral"
            gender="male">little</descriptor> man <action agency="active" gender="male"
            willingness="eager">came again</action>. She <action agency="active" gender="female"
            willingness="eager">gave him a ring from her hand</action>, and he <action
            agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eaegr">turned it all into gold</action>.</p>

    <p>The third night the king <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">had
            her locked in a third room, which was larger than the first two, and entirely filled
            with straw</action>. "If you succeed this time, <action agency="active" gender="male"
            willingness="eager">I'll <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral"
                >make you my wife</action></action>," he said.</p>

    <p>Then the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">little</descriptor> man came and said,
            "<action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">I'll do it again</action>,
        but you <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">must promise me the
            first child that you have with the king</action>."</p>

    <p>In her distress she <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">made the
            promise</action>, and when the king <action agency="active" gender="male"
            willingness="eager">saw that this straw too had been turned into gold, he took the
            miller's daughter as his wife</action>.</p>

    <p>Soon thereafter the queen <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="neutral"
            >delivered a child</action>. Then the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male"
            >little</descriptor> man <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager"
            >appeared before her and demanded the child that had been promised him</action>. The
        queen <action agency="passive" gender="female" willignness="hesitant">begged him to let her
            keep the child, offering him great riches in its place</action>.</p>

    <p>Finally he said, "I'll <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">be back to
            get the child in three days</action>. But <action agency="passive" gender="female"
            willingness="neutral">if by then you know my name, you can keep the
        child</action>.!"</p>

    <p>For two days the queen <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant"
            >pondered what the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">little</descriptor> man's
            name might be, but she could not think of anything, and became very sad</action>. On the
        third day the king <action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">came home from
            a hunt and told her how, two days earlier, while hunting deep in a dark forest, he had
            come upon a little house</action>. A <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male"
            >comical</descriptor>
        <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">little</descriptor> man <action agency="active"
            gender="male" willingness="eager">was there, jumping about as if on one leg, and crying
            out</action>:</p>

    <lg>
        <l><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Today I'll bake; tomorrow I'll
                brew</action>.</l>
        <l><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Then I'll fetch the queen's new
                child</action>.</l>
        <l>It is good that no one knows</l>
        <l>Rumpelstiltskin is my name.</l>
    </lg>

    <p>The queen <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">was overjoyed to hear
            this</action>.</p>

    <p>Then the <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">dangerous</descriptor>
        <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">little</descriptor> man arrived and asked: "Your
        majesty, what is my name?"</p>

    <p>"Is your name Conrad?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>"Is your name Heinrich?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>"Then could your name be Rumpelstiltskin?"</p>

    <p>"The devil <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">told you
            that</action>!" shouted the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">little</descriptor>
        man. He <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="hesitant">ran away angrily, and
            never came back</action>.</p>

        <note>The Grimms dressed this tale up considerably in succeeding editions. The most notable
            change is the introduction of the spinning wheel as a device for turning straw into
            gold. Further, in later editions the queen discovers the dwarf's name through a
            messenger whom she herself sends forth to collect strange names, not through her
            husband's chance meeting with the little man.</note>
