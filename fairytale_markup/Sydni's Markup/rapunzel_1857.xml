    <title>Rapunzel</title>
    <author>Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm</author>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a man and a woman who had long, but to no avail, wished for a
        child. Finally the woman came to believe that the good Lord would fulfill her wish. Through
        the small rear window of these people's house they could see into a splendid garden that was
        filled with the most beautiful flowers and herbs. The garden was surrounded by a high wall,
        and no one dared enter, because it belonged to a <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">sorceress who possessed great power and was
            feared by everyone.</descriptor></p>
    <p>One day the woman was standing at this window, and she saw a bed planted with the most
        beautiful rapunzel. It looked so fresh and green that she longed for some. It was her
        greatest desire to eat some of the rapunzel. This desire increased with every day, and not
        knowing how to get any, she became miserably ill.</p>
    <p>Her husband was frightened, and asked her, "What ails you, dear wife?"</p>
    <p>"Oh," she answered, "if I do not get some rapunzel from the garden behind our house, I shall
        die."</p>
    <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">The man, who loved her dearly, thought, "Before you let your wife die, you must get her some
        of the rapunzel, whatever the cost."</action></p>
    <p>So just as it was getting dark he climbed over the high wall into the sorceress's garden,
        hastily dug up a handful of rapunzel, and took it to his wife. She immediately made a salad
        from it, which she devoured eagerly. It tasted so very good to her that by the next day her
        desire for more had grown threefold.<action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">If she were to have any peace, the man would have to
            climb into the garden once again.</action> <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Thus he set forth once again</action> just as it was getting dark.
        But no sooner than he had climbed over the wall than, to his horror, he saw the sorceress
        standing there before him.</p>
    <p>"How can you dare," <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">she asked with an angry look,</descriptor> "to climb into my garden and like a thief
        to steal my rapunzel? You will pay for this."</p>
    <p>"Oh," he answered, "Let mercy overrule justice. I came to do this out of necessity. My wife
        saw your rapunzel from our window, and such a longing came over her, that she would die, if
        she did not get some to eat."</p>
    <p>The sorceress's anger abated somewhat, and she said, "If things are as you say, I will allow
        you to take as much rapunzel as you want. <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">But under one condition: You must give me the
        child</descriptor>that your wife will bring to the world. It will do well, and I will take care of it
        like a mother."</p>
    <p>In his fear the man agreed to everything.</p>
    <p>When the woman gave birth, the sorceress appeared, named the little girl Rapunzel, and took
        her away. Rapunzel became the most <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">beautiful</descriptor> child under the sun. When she was twelve years
        old, the sorceress locked her in a tower that stood in a forest and that had neither a door
        nor a stairway, but only a tiny little window at the very top.</p>
    <p>When the sorceress wanted to enter, she stood below and called out:</p>
    <p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>
    <p>Let down your hair to me.</p>
    <p><descriptor type="negative" gender="female">Rapunzel had splendid long hair, as fine as spun gold.</descriptor> When she heard the sorceress's voice,
        she untied her braids, wound them around a window hook, let her hair fall twenty yards to
        the ground, and the sorceress climbed up it.</p>
    <p>A few years later it happened that a king's son was riding through the forest. As he
        approached the tower he heard a song so <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">beautiful</descriptor> that he stopped to listen. It was
            Rapunzel, who was passing the time by singing with her sweet voice. The prince wanted to
        climb up to her, and looked for a door in the tower, but none was to be found.</p>
    <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">He rode home, but the song had so touched his heart that he returned to the forest every day
        and listened to it.</action> One time, as he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw the sorceress
        approach, and heard her say:</p>
    <p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>
    <p>Let down your hair.</p>
    <p>Then Rapunzel let down her strands of hair, and the sorceress climbed up them to her.</p>
    <p>"If that is the ladder into the tower,<action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">then sometime I will try my luck."</action></p>
    <p>And the next day, just as it was beginning to get dark,<action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">he went to the tower and called
        out:</action></p>
    <p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>
    <p>Let down your hair.</p>
    <p>The hair fell down, and <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">the prince climbed up.</action></p>
    <p>At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as she had never seen before came
        in to her. However, the <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">prince began talking to her in a very friendly manner,</descriptor> telling her
        that his heart had been so touched by her singing that he could have no peace until he had
        seen her in person. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him
        as her husband, she thought, <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="neutral">He would rather have me than would old Frau Gothel." She said
            yes and placed her hand into his.</action></p>
    <p>She said, <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">I would go with you gladly, but I do not know how to get down. Every time that you
        come, bring a strand of silk, from which I will weave a ladder. When it is finished I will
        climb down, and you can take me away on your horse."</action> They arranged that he would come to her
        every evening, for the old woman came by day.</p>
    <p>The sorceress did not notice what was happening until one day Rapunzel said to her, "Frau
        Gothel, tell me why it is that you are more difficult to pull up than is the young prince,
        who will be arriving any moment now?"</p>
    <p><descriptor type="negative" gender="female">You godless child," cried the sorceress. "What am I hearing from you? I thought I had
        removed you from the whole world, but you have deceived me nonetheless."</descriptor></p>
    <p><descriptor type="negative" gender="female">In her anger</descriptor> she grabbed <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">Rapunzel's beautiful hair</descriptor>, wrapped it a few times around her left
        hand, grasped a pair of scissors with her right hand, and snip snap, cut it off. And she was
        so unmerciful that she took Rapunzel into a wilderness where she suffered greatly.</p>
    <p>On the evening of the same day that she sent Rapunzel away, the sorceress tied the cut-off
        hair to the hook at the top of the tower, and when the prince called out:</p>
    <p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>
    <p>Let down your hair.</p>
    <p><action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">she let down the hair.</action></p>
    <p><descriptor type="positive" gender="male">The prince climbed up,</descriptor> but above, instead of his <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">beloved Rapunzel,</descriptor> he found the <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">sorceress,
        who peered at him with poisonous and evil looks.</descriptor></p>
    <p>"Aha!" <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">she cried scornfully.</descriptor> "You have come for your Mistress Darling, but that <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">beautiful
        bird</descriptor> is no longer sitting in her nest, nor is she singing any more. The cat got her, and
        will scratch your eyes out as well. You have lost Rapunzel. You will never see her
        again."</p>
    <p>The prince was overcome with grief, and <action agency="active" gender="male">in his despair he threw himself from the tower.</action> He
        escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell poked out his eyes. Blind, he
        wandered about in the forest, eating nothing but grass and roots, and doing nothing but
        weeping and wailing over the loss of his <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">beloved wife.</descriptor> Thus he wandered about miserably for
        some years, finally happening into the wilderness where Rapunzel lived miserably with the
        twins that she had given birth to.</p>
    <p>He heard a voice and thought it was familiar. He advanced toward it, and as he approached,
        <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">Rapunzel recognized him, and crying, threw her arms around his neck.</action> <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">Two of her tears fell
        into his eyes, and they became clear once again, and he could see as well as before.</action> <empty happyending="true">He led
        her into his kingdom, where he was received with joy, and for a long time they lived happily
        and satisfied.</empty></p>
