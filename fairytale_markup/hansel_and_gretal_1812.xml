        <p>Next to a great forest there lived a <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">poor
                woodcutter</descriptor> who had come upon such hard times that he could scarcely
            provide daily bread for his wife and his two children, Hansel and Gretel. <action
                agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">Finally he could no longer even
                manage this,</action> and he did not know where to turn for help.</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">One evening as he was lying in
                bed worrying about his problems,</action> his wife said to him, "Listen, man, early
            tomorrow take the two children, give each of them a little piece of bread, then lead
            them into the middle of thickest part of the woods, make a fire for them, and leave them
            there, for we can no longer feed them."</p>
        <p>"No, woman," said the man, <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="hesitant">I
                cannot bring myself to abandon my own children to wild animals that would quickly
                tear them to pieces."</action></p>
        <p>"If you don't do it," said the woman, "all of us will starve together," <action
                agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">and she gave him no peace until
                he said yes.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="mixed" willingness="neutral">The two children were still
                awake from hunger and heard everything that the mother had said to the
                father.</action></p>
        <p>Gretel thought that <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral">she
                was doomed and began to cry pitifully,</action> but Hansel said, "Be quiet, Gretel,
            and don't worry. <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">I know what
                to do."</action></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">With that he got up, pulled on
                his jacket, opened the lower door, and crept outside.</action></p>
        <p>The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles were glistening like silver coins.
                <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Hansel bent over and
                filled his jacket pockets with them, as many as would fit.</action></p>
        <p>Then he went back into the house and said, "Don't worry, Gretel. Sleep well." Then he
            went back to bed, and fell asleep.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">The next morning the mother
                came and woke them both</action> before sunrise, "Get up, you children. We are going
            into the woods. Here is a little piece of bread. Take care and save it until
            midday."</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">Gretel put the bread under
                her apron, because Hansel's pockets were full of stones,</action> and <action
                agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">they set forth into the
                woods.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">After they had walked a little
                way,</action> Hansel <action gender="male" agency="active" willingness="hesitant"
                >began stopping again and again and looking back toward the house.</action></p>
        <p>The father said, "Hansel, why are you stopping and looking back? Pay attention now, and
            keep up with us."</p>
        <p>"Oh, father, I am looking at my white cat that is sitting on the roof and wants to say
            good-bye to me."</p>
        <p>The mother said, <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">"You fool,</descriptor> that
            isn't your cat. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."</p>
        <p>However, <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Hansel had not been
                looking at his cat but instead had been dropping the shiny pebbles from his pocket
                onto the path.</action></p>
        <p>When they arrived in the middle of the woods, the father said, "You children gather some
            wood, and I will make a fire so we won't freeze."</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">Hansel and Gretel gathered
                together some twigs,</action> a pile as high as a small mountain</p>
        <p>They set it afire, and when the flames were burning well, the mother said, "Lie down by
            the fire and sleep. We will go into the woods to cut down trees. Wait until we come back
            and get you."</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="mixed" willingness="neutral">Hansel and Gretel sat by
                the fire until midday, and then ate their bread.</action></p>
        <p>They <action gender="mixed" agency="passive" willingness="hesitant">sat on until
                evening</action>, but the mother and father <action agency="active" gender="mixed"
                willingness="eager">did not return</action>, and no one came to get them.</p>
        <p>When it became dark, <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral"
                >Gretel began to cry,</action> but Hansel said, "Wait a little until the moon comes
            up."</p>
        <p>After the moon had come up, <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">he
                took Gretel by the hand.</action></p>
        <p>The pebbles were lying there like newly minted coins. Glistening, they showed them the
            way.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">They walked throughout the
                entire night, and as morning was breaking, they arrived at the father's
                house.</action></p>
        <p>The father was <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">overjoyed</descriptor> when he
            saw his children once more, for he had not wanted to leave them alone. The mother
            pretended that she too was happy, but secretly she was <descriptor type="negative"
                gender="female">angry.</descriptor></p>
        <p>Not long afterward there was once again no bread in the house, and one evening Hansel and
            Gretel heard the mother say to the father, "The children found their way back once, and
            I let it be, but again we have only a half loaf of bread in the house. Tomorrow you must
            take them deeper into the woods, so they cannot find their way home. Otherwise there
            will be no help for us."</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="hesitant">The man was very
                disheartened, and he thought it would be better to share the last bit with the
                children, but because he had done it once, he could not say no.</action></p>
        <p>Hansel and Gretel <action gender="mixed" agency="passive" willingness="neutral">heard the
                parents' conversation.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Hansel got up and wanted to
                gather pebbles once again,</action> but when he came to the door, he found that
                <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral">the mother had locked
                it.</action></p>
        <p>Still, he <action gender="male" agency="active" willingness="eager">comforted Gretel and
                said, "Just go to sleep, Gretel dear. God will help us."</action></p>
        <p>Early the next morning they <action agency="passive" gender="mixed" willingness="neutral"
                >received their little pieces of bread</action>, even less than the last time.</p>
        <p>On the way, <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Hansel crumbled his
                piece in his pocket, then often stood still, and threw crumbs onto the
                ground.</action></p>
        <p>"Why are you always stopping and looking around?" said his father. "Keep walking straight
            ahead."</p>
        <p>"Oh!, I can see my pigeon sitting on the roof. It wants to say good-bye to me."</p>
        <p><descriptor type="negative" gender="male">"You fool,"</descriptor> said his mother, "that
            isn't your pigeon. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">But Hansel crumbled all of his
                bread and dropped the crumbs onto the path.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">The mother took them deeper
                into the woods than they had ever been in their whole lifetime.</action></p>
        <p>There they were told to sleep by a large fire, and that the parents would come and get
            them in the evening.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">At midday Gretel shared her
                bread with Hansel, because he had scattered all of his along the path.</action></p>
        <p>Midday passed, and evening passed, but no one came to get the <descriptor type="negative"
                gender="mixed">poor</descriptor> children.</p>
        <p>Hansel comforted Gretel and said, "Wait, when the moon comes up I will be able to see the
            crumbs of bread that I scattered, and they will show us the way back home."</p>
        <p>The moon came up, but when <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager"
                >Hansel looked for the crumbs, they were gone.</action> The many thousands of birds
            in the woods had found them and pecked them up.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Hansel thought that he would
                still be able to find the way home,</action> and <action agency="active"
                gender="mixed" willingness="eager">he and Gretel set forth, but they soon became
                totally lost in the great wilderness.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">They walked through the night
                and the entire next day, and then, <descriptor type="negative" gender="mixed"
                    >exhausted</descriptor>, they fell asleep. They walked another day, but they
                could not find their way out of the woods.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="mixed" willingness="hesitant">They were terribly hungry,
                for they had eaten only a few small berries that were growing on the
                ground.</action></p>
        <p>On the third day <action agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">they walked
                until midday when they came to a little house</action> built entirely from bread
            with a roof made of cake, and the windows were made of clear sugar.</p>
        <p>"Let's sit down and eat our fill," said Hansel. "I'll eat from the roof, and Gretel, you
            eat from the window. That will be nice and sweet for you."</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="mixed" willingness="neutral">Hansel had already eaten a
                piece from the roof and Gretel had eaten a few round windowpanes, and she had just
                broken out another one when she heard a gentle voice calling out from
                inside:</action></p>
        <lg>
            <l>Nibble, nibble, little mouse,</l>
            <l>Who is nibbling at my house?</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Hansel and Gretel were so frightened that they dropped what they were holding in their
            hands, and immediately they saw a <descriptor type="negative" gender="female">little
                woman, as old as the hills,</descriptor> creeping out the door.</p>
        <p>She shook her head and said, "Oh, you dear children, where did you come from? Come inside
            with me, and you will be just fine."</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">She took them by the hand and
                led them into her house.</action></p>
        <p>Then <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">she served them a good
                meal:</action> pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts; and made two nice beds for
            them.</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="mixed" willingness="neutral">Hansel and Gretel went to
                bed, thinking it was though they were in heaven.</action></p>
        <p>But the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female">old</descriptor> woman was a
                <descriptor gender="female" type="negative">wicked witch</descriptor> who was lying
            in wait there for children.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">She had built her house of
                bread in order to lure them to her, and if she captured one, she would kill him,
                cook him, and eat him; and for her that was a day to celebrate.</action></p>
        <p>So she was <descriptor type="positive" gender="female">overjoyed</descriptor> that Hansel
            and Gretel had found their way to her.</p>
        <p>Early the next morning, before they awoke, <action agency="active" gender="female"
                willingness="eager">she got up, went to their beds, and looked at the two of them
                lying there</action> so peacefully.</p>
        <p>"They will be a good mouthful," she thought.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">She grabbed Hansel and put
                him in a little stall,</action> and when he awoke, he found himself in a cage,
            locked up <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">like a young dog</descriptor>, and
            he could walk only a few steps.</p>
        <p>Then <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">she shook Gretel and
                cried,</action> "Get up, <descriptor type="negative" gender="female"
                >lazybones!</descriptor> Fetch water. Go into the kitchen and cook something to eat.
            Your brother is locked in that stall there. I want to fatten him up, and <action
                agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">when he is fat I am going to eat
                him.</action> For now, you have to feed him."</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">Gretel was <descriptor
                    type="negative" gender="female">frightened</descriptor> and cried, but she had
                to do what the witch demanded.</action></p>
        <p>Now Hansel was given the best things to eat every day, so he would get fat, but Gretel
            received nothing but crayfish shells.</p>
        <p>Every day the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female">old</descriptor> woman came and
            said, "Hansel, stick out your finger, so I can feel if you are fat enough yet."</p>
        <p>But <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">Hansel always stuck out a
                little bone,</action> and she wondered why he didn't get any fatter.</p>
        <p>After four weeks, one evening she said to Gretel, "Hurry up and fetch some water. Whether
            your brother is fat enough now or not, tomorrow <action agency="active" gender="female"
                willingness="eager">I am going to slaughter him and boil him.</action> In the
            meantime I want to start the dough that we will bake to go with him."</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="hesitant">With a sad heart Gretel
                fetched the water in which Hansel was to be boiled.</action></p>
        <p>The next morning Gretel had to get up early, make a fire, and hang up the kettle with
            water.</p>
        <p>"Watch it until it boils," said the witch. "I am going to make a fire in the oven and put
            the bread into it."</p>
        <p><action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="neutral">Gretel stood in the
                kitchen and cried tears of blood and thought that it would have been better if wild
                animals had devoured them in the woods,</action> for then they would at least have
            died together and would not now be suffering so, and she herself would not have to be
            boiling the water that would kill her dear brother; and she prayed, "Dear God, save us
            poor children."</p>
        <p>Then the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female">old</descriptor> woman called,
            "Gretel, come here right now to the oven."</p>
        <p>And when Gretel came, she said, "Look inside and see if the bread is nicely brown and
            done, for my eyes are weak, and I can't see that far. If you can't see that far either,
            then sit on the board, and I'll push you inside, then you can walk around inside and
            take a look."</p>
        <p>But once Gretel was inside, the <descriptor type="negative" gender="female"
                >witch</descriptor> intended to close the door, and bake her in the hot oven, and
            eat her as well. That is what the <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">wicked
                witch</descriptor> was thinking, and that is why she called Gretel.</p>
        <p>However, God let <action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">Gretel know
                this, so she said, "I don't know how to do that. First show me. You sit on the
                board, and I will push you inside."</action></p>
        <p>So the <descriptor gender="female" type="neutral">old</descriptor> woman sat on the
            board, and since she was light, <action agency="active" gender="female"
                willingness="eager">Gretel pushed her all the way inside, then quickly closed the
                door and secured it with an iron bar.</action></p>
        <p>The <descriptor type="neutral" gender="female">old</descriptor> woman in the hot oven
            began to cry and to wail, but Gretel ran away, and the <descriptor type="neutral"
                gender="female">old</descriptor> woman burned up miserably.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="female" willingness="eager">Gretel ran to Hansel and
                unlocked his door.</action></p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">He jumped out,</action> and
            they kissed each other and were overjoyed.</p>
        <p>The whole house was filled with precious stones and pearls.</p>
        <p><action agency="active" gender="mixed" willingness="eager">They filled their pockets,
                then ran away and found their way back home.</action></p>
        <p>The <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">father rejoiced when he saw them once more,
                for he had not had a happy day since they had been gone,</descriptor> and now he was
            a <descriptor type="positive" gender="male">rich man.</descriptor> However, the mother
            had died.</p>
