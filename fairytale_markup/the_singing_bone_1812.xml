        <p>A wild boar was wreaking havoc throughout the country. No one dared venture into the
            forest where it ran about. With its tusks it ripped to pieces anyone who was bold enough
            to pursue it and attempt to kill it. Then the king <action agency="active" gender="male"
                willingness="eager">proclaimed that anyone who could kill the boar would receive his
                daughter for a wife</action>.</p>
        <p>There were three brothers in the kingdom. The <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male"
                >oldest</descriptor> was <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">sly</descriptor>
            and <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">clever</descriptor>; the second was of
                <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">ordinary intelligence</descriptor>; but the
            third and <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">youngest</descriptor> was <descriptor
                type="positive" gender="male">innocent</descriptor> and <descriptor type="negative"
                gender="male">slow witted</descriptor>. They <action agency="active" gender="male"
                willingness="eager">wanted to win the princess, so they set forth to seek out the
                wild boar and kill it</action>.</p>

        <p>The <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">two oldest</descriptor> ones went together,
            while the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">youngest</descriptor> one went by
            himself. When he <action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="eager">entered the
                woods an old man approached him. He was holding a black lance in his hand, and said
                to him, "Take this lance and fearlessly attack the boar with it, and you will kill
                it." And that is what happened. He struck the boar with the lance, and it fell dead
                to the earth. Then he lifted it onto his shoulder, and cheerfully set off toward
                home</action>.</p>

        <p>On the way he <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">came to a house
                where his brothers were making merry and drinking wine</action>. When they saw him
            with the boar on his back, they called to him, "Come in and have a drink with us. You
            must be tired." The <descriptor type="negative" gender="male">innocent
                simpleton</descriptor>, not thinking about any danger, <action agency="passive"
                gender="male" willingness="eager">went inside and told them how he had killed the
                boar with the black lance, and rejoiced in his good fortune</action>. That evening
            they returned home together. The <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male">two
                oldest</descriptor> ones <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager"
                >plotted to kill their brother</action>. They let him <action agency="passive"
                gender="male" willingness="neutral">walk ahead of them</action>, and when they came
            to a bridge just outside the city, they <action agency="active" gender="male"
                willingness="eager">attacked him, striking him dead. They buried him beneath the
                bridge</action>. Then the <descriptor type="neutral" gender="male"
                >oldest</descriptor> one <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager"
                >took the boar, carried it to the king, claimed that he had killed it</action>, and
                <action agency="passive" gender="female" willingness="eager">received the princess
                for a wife</action>.</p>

        <p>Many years passed, but it was not to remain hidden. One day a <descriptor type="neutral"
                gender="male">shepherd</descriptor>
            <action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="neutral"> was crossing the bridge
                when he saw a little bone beneath him in the sand</action>. It was so pure and
            snow-white that he wanted it to make a mouthpiece from, so he <action agency="active"
                gender="male" willingness="eager">climbed down and picked it up. Afterward he made a
                mouthpiece from it for his horn</action>, and when he put it to his lips to play,
            the little bone began to sing by itself:</p>

        <lg>
            <l>Oh, dear shepherd</l>
            <l>You are blowing on my bone.</l>
            <l>My brothers <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">struck me
                    dead</action>,</l>
            <l>And <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">buried me beneath the
                    bridge</action>,</l>
            <l>To get the wild boar</l>
            <l>For the daughter of the king.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The shepherd <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">took the horn to
                the king</action>, and once again it sang the same words. After hearing this, the
            king <action agency="active" gender="male" willingness="eager">had his people dig under
                the bridge, and they soon uncovered the skeleton</action>. The two <descriptor
                type="negative" gender="male">wicked</descriptor> brothers <action agency="active"
                gender="male" willingness="hesitant">confessed their crime</action> and <action
                agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="hesitant">were thrown into the
                water</action>. The <action agency="passive" gender="male" willingness="neutral"
                >murdered</action> brother's bones <action agency="passive" gender="male"
                willingness="neutral">were laid to rest in a beautiful grave in the
                churchyard</action>.</p>
