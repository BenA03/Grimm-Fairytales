# Grimm's Fairy Tales

## Our research questions

As our project develops, we anticipate the creation of new or more specific reseach questions.
These are the questions that are currently facilitating our research:

- Do the Grimm's Fairy Tale's tend to get darker over time?
- Are children always represented as naive within the stories?
- How does the association between the fairy tales and marketing towards children 
lead to a shift in content within the stories?

## Our corpus
Since there are many translations and editions of the Grimm's Fairytales, 
we have decided to use one source for our research. The collection, included below,
was compiled by D. L. Ashliman, who was a professor at The University of Pittsburgh.
His site allows us to view English translations of many of the works, in addition to 
offering a comparison between the 1812 and 1857 editions.
